# soundrel-webgame
the card game scoundrel, but as a js app, three versions. no-map has.. no map and no game extras, -map has a map for the dungeoncrawl look, v2 has a refined UI.

There is also Scoundrel-Persona, baised and changed to fit in with the Persona 5 games look, this was just an experiment and wont be updated but you can play it anyway.
